              <p>Chet first discovered his love for fitness while noticing elevated energy levels and increased endurance while at Boot Camp for the Army National Guard. This prompted him to want to share the elevated feeling, so he became a certified personal trainer in 2008. Since then, he has helped a myriad of clients with weight loss, strength gain, muscle toning, and lifestyle wellness.</p>

              <p>Chet has been serving in the Army National Guard since 2005. He has been deployed to Iraq and Kuwait as Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic and Electronic Warfare Specialist. He also holds the title of Certified Resiliency Instructor, where his love for teaching comes to life. Topics of expertise include: Stress Management, Conflict Resolution, Physical Fitness, Problem Solving, Goal Setting, Gratitude Recognition, Action-Thought-Feelings Alignment, Energy Management, and many more.</p>
